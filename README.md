# Creating-Social-Networks-
A compilation of code for the creation of several social networks in R, including pictures of the results

Unfortunately, due to privacy reasons, I cannot share the source data on which these networks were built. I can however share my R Files as well as pictures of the completed social networks for an understanding of how I clean data, and effectively prepare it to be fed into R to create a network. Included are multiple RFiles for different projects, as well as pictures of the results since you cannot run the R files without the data. 

Created by Ethan Bhojani using R in RStudio.
